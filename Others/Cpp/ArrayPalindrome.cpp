// ! Find minimum number of merge operations to make array palindrome

/*
Given a list of non-negative integers, find the minimum number of merge operations
to make a palindrome. A merge operation can only be performed on two adjacent elements
The result of a merge operation is that the two adjacent elements are replaced with their sum.

Testcase:
    input -> [6,1,3,7]
    output -> 1

    explanation : merge index 0 and 1 i.e [6, 1] = [7,3,7]

    [6,1,4,3,1,7]
    ans = 2
    merge index 0,1 and 3, 4
    [7,4,4,7]

    [1,3,3,1]
    ans = 0
    already palindrome
